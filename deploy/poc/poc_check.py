"""Checks the PoC of the runtime split (ADR-0002, ADR-0003) against `docker-compose.poc.yml`.

    docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.poc.yml up -d --build
    uv run python deploy/poc/poc_check.py

1. each pod serves only its feature;
2. synchronous call over HTTP: `create-company` of the company profile asks the registration (service
   token) and maps its 404;
3. event over the inbox: the `CompanyDeactivated` of the company profile arrives at the registration pod.
Exit code 0 = green. The state is in memory: restart the pods to run it again.
