"""HTTP controllers of the installation that belong to no module (base skeleton, FRAMEWORK 1).

Layout as in the Industry Core Hub backend: one folder per API category under `routers/`, one
folder per version, one file per controller with its own `router`:

    controllers/fastapi/routers/<category>/v1/<feature>.py   router = APIRouter(prefix="/<category>")

`include(app)` mounts every controller under `/api/v1`, e.g. `POST /api/v1/events/inbox`. The APIs of
the modules stay in `modules/<id>/router.py` under `/api/<module>` (FRAMEWORK 4.1); a new category
gets its own folder here and one line in `v1_router()`.
