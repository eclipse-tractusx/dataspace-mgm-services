# C1-M3 Application Review: open questions of the implementation

| No. | Question | Spec | Reading implemented | Who decides |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | README 4 names the neighbour addresses `REGISTRATION_URL`, `COMPANY_URL`, `CSP_CONNECTION_URL`; the kit resolves `C1_M2_URL`, `C3_M1_URL`, `C3_M2_URL` / `MODULE_URLS`. | README 4, FRAMEWORK 4.7, AGENTS.md rule 6 | Addresses through `portal_common.neighbours` only; the names of README 4 are not read. | spec authors |
| 2 | Where is `signatureCheck`? README 6.2 says `signatureCheck.result`; the C1-M2 schema has it in `attestation` (`AttestationDetail`). | README 6.2, C1-M2 openapi `AttestationDetail` | `attestation.signatureCheck`, falling back to a top-level `signatureCheck`. | C1-M2 |
| 3 | `ATTESTATION_VALID` with `signatureCheck` `UNAVAILABLE` gives `ERROR`, so `open-review` answers 502 `upstream-error` and Process Orchestration repeats until the JWKS is back. | README 6.2, 8.1 | As written. | OSPs, C12-M1 |
| 4 | `open-review` reads the application again only while the case is new or `OPEN`; for a decided or closed case it reads nothing (8.1 step 1 reads always). | README 8.1 | No read for a case that is not `OPEN`: nothing would change, and a closed case of a withdrawn application should not fail on C1-M2. | spec authors |
| 6 | A2 to A17 of 14.2 have no fixed `id`, `companyId`, EBWOID and EUID. | README 14.2 | Derived deterministic IDs in the tests (`standin.stable_id`). | spec authors |
| 7 | `expected` in `cspMatches` for outcomes other than `EXPECTED_MATCH`. | README 6.3 | `true` only for the match of `EXPECTED_MATCH`, otherwise `false` for every match. | spec authors |
| 8 | 7.3 step 2 reads the status at C1-M2 before the row lock; an unknown application (empty summary) is not withdrawn. | README 7.3 | Decision continues if C1-M2 does not know the application. | C1-M2 |
| 9 | No event for `AWAITING_SECOND_APPROVAL`, so Notifications cannot tell the second reviewer. | OP-49 | Publishes `ApplicationAwaitingSecondApproval` (OP-49) with application and first approval metadata. | resolved (OP-49) |
| 10 | Persistence: README 4 asks for PostgreSQL `c1_m3`; the hackathon kit keeps data in memory. One lock replaces `SELECT … FOR UPDATE`. | README 4, 6.8 | In memory, one module-wide lock. | organisers |
| 11 | A neighbour that rejects the request (4xx): README 8.1 says a check with `ERROR` always answers 502 `upstream-error` with `retryable` `true`; the error rule of the kit gives `neighbour-rejected` with `retryable` `false`. | README 8.1, 12; `portal_common.neighbours` | If every check with `ERROR` was rejected: 502 `neighbour-rejected`, `retryable` `false`, so Process Orchestration does not repeat in vain; the check stays `ERROR` and a repetition runs it again. With a temporary error among them: 502 `upstream-error`, `retryable` `true`. | spec authors, C12-M1 |
