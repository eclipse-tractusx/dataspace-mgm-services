"""Company profile (spec C3-M1): the company of a member, its identifiers, roles and change requests.

Process Orchestration creates and activates the company after a registration; people keep their own
company up to date, OSP staff review change requests and administer companies.

Index of the feature (layout in `features/__init__.py`): `NAME`, `MODULE` and the lifecycle hook a runtime
calls, `reset()` (empty state plus seed data, README 4). The HTTP API is `features.company_profile.router.router`.
